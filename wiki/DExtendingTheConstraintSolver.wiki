#summary This section describes how to extend the constraint programming solver with new decision builders, new local search, and new constraints.

In order to write a new decision builder and new decisions, you will need to include `constraint_solver/constraint_solver.h`. 
In order to write new Local Search operators, or new constraints, you will need to include `constraint_solver/constraint_solveri.h`.
