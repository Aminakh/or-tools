The directory algorithms/ proposes
  * *[Hungarian Method]* to solve assignment problems with linear cost.

The directory graph/ proposes 3 algorithms:
  * *[Bron-Kerbosch]* to find cliques in an undirected graph.
  * *[Dijkstra]* algorithm to find shortest paths in a directed graph with non negative costs.
  * *[Bellman-Ford]* algorithm to find shortest paths in a directed graph with arbitrary costs.
