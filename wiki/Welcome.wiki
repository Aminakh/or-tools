= or-tools library's documentation =

This project hosts open source *operations research tools* developed at _Google_.

Although there is a main [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/documentation_hub.html or-tools documentation hub], 
it is currently quite empty.

You can see our progress [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/documentation_hub.html#progress here].

We are working hard to provide a user's manual, 
presentation slides and even  lab sessions.

In the meantime:
    * have a look at the examples in [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples C++], [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python Python], [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com/google/ortools Java] and [http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/csharp C#];
    * ask your questions on the [http://groups.google.com/group/or-tools-discuss mailing list].
