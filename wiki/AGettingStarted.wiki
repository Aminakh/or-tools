=Installing with a binary archives for dependencies =

Dependencies have been created for Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and 10.10 (32 and 64 bit), and visual studio 10 (32 bit).

First, create the or-tools svn copy where you want to work. All dependencies will be placed at the same level, along side this directory.

For linux users, please intall swig, python-setuptools python-dev
{{{
sudo apt-get install swig python-setuptools python-dev
}}}

Then uncompress the archives (generic dependencies, glpk, and cbc) from  in the same directory you will create the or-tools svn repository.

{{{
tar xvzf google-or-tools-dependencies-<OS specific>.tar.gz
}}}

Go into google-apputils-0.1

run 

{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

Please copy Makefile.def to Makefile.local and edit Makefile.local to accommodate your installation.

=Installing under Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X=

This library has been tested under Ubuntu Linux 10.04, 10.10, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) with xcode 3.2.x.
It is known not to compile with xcode 3.1.x running under Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).

First, create the or-tools svn copy where you want to work. All dependencies will be placed at the same level, along side this directory.

For linux users, please intall swig, python-setuptools python-dev
{{{
sudo apt-get install swig python-setuptools python-dev
}}}

For Mac OS X users, please install xcode from the apple developer site:

http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html

First, you will need to install the google-gflags library, compile it
and install it. It can be obtained at the following address:

http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/

By default, the makefile assumes the installation path is
../gflags-1.5 from the Makefile, thus at the same level as the
or-tools directory.

Then you need to install protocol buffers. You can fetch them at http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ . The makefile default path is ../protobuf-2.3.0 from the location of the or-tools Makefile.

It is recommanded you also install linear solver:
   * GLPK from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/ . Install it in ../glpk-4.45
   * Coin Branch and Cut from http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/ . Install it in ../cbc-2.6.4

Finally, you need to install google-apputils from:
http://code.google.com/p/google-apputils-python/

Download, untar and then run python setup.py install.

Please copy Makefile.def to Makefile.local and edit Makefile.local to accommodate your installation.


=Installing under generic Unix/Linux=

First you need to compile the C++ libraries:
  # Create a repertory that will hold all source code. I will refer to this as `_work_`.
  # Create the `_work_/install` repertory.
  # Download google-gflags from http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/ and untar in `_work_/install`
  # Step into `_work_/install/gflags-1.4` and run the following command:
    * `./configure --prefix=_work_/gflags-1.4`
    * `make`
    * `make install`
Download protobuf  from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ and untar in `_work_/install`
  # Step into `_work_/install/gprotobuf-2.3.0` and run the following command:
    * `./configure --prefix=_work_/protobuf-2.3.0`
    * `make`
    * `make install`

It is recommanded you also install linear solver:
   * GLPK from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/ . Install it in ../glpk-4.45
   * Coin Branch and Cut from http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/ . Install it in ../cbc-2.6.4

Then you can compile the python library.

You will need 3 things: swig, python.h and python dev packages, and python_apputils.

Finally, you need to install google-apputils from:
http://code.google.com/p/google-apputils-python/

Download, untar it into `_work_/install/google-apputils-0.1` (Create the google-apputils-0.1 directory first as the archive does not have a leading directory) and then run `python setup.py install`.
It will install different packages include python-gflags.

Please copy Makefile.def to Makefile.local and edit Makefile.local to accommodate your installation.

=Installing under Microsoft Windows=

First, download the or-tools source code using the svn command found at:
http://code.google.com/p/or-tools/source/checkout

Then install dependencies. They will all be installed alongside the or-tools directory:

First, you will need to download the google-gflags library. It can be obtained at the following address:

http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/downloads/detail?name=gflags-1.5.zip

Decompress alongside the or-tools directory.

To install google gflags libraries on windows:
  * go in `<gflags_dir>`/vsprojects/libgflags
  * load the libgflags.vcproj project
  * You may have to upgrade it on the fly if you are using Visual Studio 2010.
  * If you want to build in 64 bit mode (recommended), follow the instructions here:
      http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/trunk/README_windows.txt
  * Select Release mode, select win32 or x64
  * Build the solution.

Please modify the Makefile.msv in or-tools to point to the source of the gflags source directory.

Then you need to install zlib.
First get the archive at: http://zlib.net/zlib125.zip

install the zlib source archive, step into it.  

First put the correct makefile.msc in win32. You can get it at:
 http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/resources/Makefile.msc

Then open a command prompt from the visual studio tools menu, with the correct environment (win32 or x64). Then go to the zlib directory, and run:

{{{nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc}}}

directly at this point. 

Then you need to install protocol buffers. You can fetch them at  http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protobuf-2.3.0.zip

The makefile default path is ../protobuf-2.3.0 from the location of the or-tools Makefile.msv.
To install do the following:
   * Unzip the archive
   * rename the directory protobuf-src-2.3.0
   * go into the protobuf-src-2.3.0/vsprojects subdirectory.
   * load the sln and compile the project in release mode (win32 and x64). Please ignore the errors. You will need the protoc executable and the libprotobuf libraries.
   * go into the protobuf-src-2.3.0/vsprojects directory, run the extract_includes.bat script
   * Create the protobuf-2.3.0 directory at the same level as or-tools
   * move the protobuf-src-2.3.0/vsprojects/include directory into the protobuf-2.3.0 directory
   * create protobuf-2.3.0/lib directory and move protobuf-src-2.3.0/vsprojects/Release/`*`.lib into this directory
   * create protobuf-2.3.0/bin directory and move protobuf-src-2.3.0/vsprojects/Release/protoc.exe into this directory.

To use Python, you need to install python and swigwin and some dependencies:

This has been tested with swigwin-2.0.x available from there:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-2.0.3.zip

and python from 

http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

You need to install google-apputils from:
http://code.google.com/p/google-apputils-python/

Download, create a google-apputils-0.1 directory, untar the archive in this directory, and then run python setup.py install.

You may need to install python-setuptools for windows. Please fetch it from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files .

Then copy Makefile.def to Makefile.local in or-tools, and modify it to point to the root of the protobuf source tree.



and run the examples as in:

{{{python.exe python\simple_meeting.py}}}

=Compiling libraries and running examples=


You can query the list of targets just by typing

{{{make}}}

You can then compile the library, examples and python wrapping for the constraint solver, the linear solver wrappers, and the algorithms:

{{{make all}}}


To compile in debug mode, please use

{{{make DEBUG=-g cpexe pycp}}}

or

{{{make DEBUG="/Od /Zi" cpexe pycp}}}

under windows.


You can clean everything using

{{{make clean}}}

When everything is compiled, you will find under operations_research:
  * some static libraries (libcp.a, libutil.a and libbase.a, and more)
  * One binary per C++ example (e.g. nqueens)
  * C++ wrapping libraries (_pywrapcp.so, linjniwrapconstraint_solver.so)
  * Java jars (com.google.ortools.constraintsolver.jar...)

You can execute C++ examples just by running then:

{{{./magic_square }}}


For the python examples, as we have not installed the constraint_solver module, we need to use the following command:


on windows:
{{{set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;<path to or-tools>}}}, then {{{c:\Python27\python.exe python/sample.py}}}.


On unix:
{{{PYTHONPATH= <python_binary> python/<sample.py>}}}

As in

{{{PYTHONPATH= python2.6 python/golomb8.py}}}

You can run java examples with the run[_<name>] makefile target as in:

{{{make run_RabbitsPheasants}}}

This has been tested with python 2.5 and 2.6.
The wrapping using SWIG has been tested with SWIG 1.3.40 and 1.3.31.
