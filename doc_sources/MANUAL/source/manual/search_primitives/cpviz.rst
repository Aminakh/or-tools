    To get a better feeling of the way the CP solver explores the search tree,
    we will use the wonderful *open-source visualization toolkit for finite 
    domain constraint programming*. Here is a description from their website of what :program:`cpviz` provides:
    
    ..  code-block:: text
    
        It provides visualization for search trees, variables and global 
        constraints through a post-mortem analysis of trace logs.
    
    Please find all necessary information and tools at
    
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpviz/

``TreeMonitor``\s to provide the :program:`cpviz` input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  only:: draft

    To monitor the search, we use ``SearchMonitor``\s. The ``TreeMonitor`` class inherits from ``SearchMonitor`` and 
    creates the files needed by cpviz to visualize the search: :file:`tree.xml` and :file:`visualization.xml`.
    
    To produce :program:`cpviz` output for your search, add the following to your code:

    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        vector<SearchMonitor*> monitors;
        ...
        SearchMonitor* const cpviz = s.MakeTreeMonitor(vars, "tree.xml",
                                                       "visualization.xml");
        monitors.push_back(cpviz);
        
    ..  only:: html 
    
        You need also a configuration file (named ``configuration.xml``) as this one:
        
        You can download it :download:`here <configuration.xml>`.
        
    ..  only:: latex
    
        You need also a configuration file (named ``configuration.xml``) as this one:
        
    ..  code-block:: xml 
        
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <configuration version="1.0" directory="/tmp"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="configuration.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://
        www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <tool show="tree" type="layout" display="expanded" repeat="all"
        width="700" height="700" fileroot="tree"/>
        <tool show="viz" type="layout" display="expanded" repeat="all"
        width="700" height="700" fileroot="viz"/>
        </configuration>
            
    Basically, it tells :program:`cpviz` to produces  the graphic files for the 
    search tree (``show="tree"``) and the variables (``show="viz"``) 
    in the directory :file:`/tmp/`.
    
    If you are really lazy, we even have provided a factory method which 
    generates automatically a configuration file:
    
    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        SearchMonitor* const cpviz = s.MakeTreeMonitor(vars, 
                                                       "configuration.xml", 
                                                       "tree.xml",
                                                       "visualization.xml");

        
    After your search is finished AND you have called (implicitley or explicitly)
    ``EndSearch()`` (files are created in the ``ÃˆxitSearch()`` callback),
    you can run :program:`cpviz` to digest the XML output of your search by going to :file:`viz/bin` and
    typing:
    
    ..  code-block:: bash
    
        java ie.ucc.cccc.viz.Viz configuration.xml tree.xml visualization.xml 
    
    on a command line into a terminal near you to produce the following picture of the search tree:

    This is probably not what you expected. First of all, this is not a binary tree. There seems to be an extra dummy root node.
    A binary tree --- which is what is exactly used during the search --- is not really suited for a graphical representation as it can 
    quickly become very big (compare with the actual search tree that is represented below). To avoid huge trees, we have reduced their 
    sizes by contracting several nodes. Except for the dummy root node, each node is denoted by a variable name. The numbers along the branches
    denote ...
    

Interpreting the graphic results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  only:: draft

    To better understand the output of cpviz and to follow the search with precision,
    let's trace the search and the propagation of our program ``nqueens4``:

    ..  code-block:: bash
    
        ./nqueens4 --size=4 --cp_trace_search --cp_trace_propagation 2> 
                                                    cpviz_nqueens4_basic.txt
        
    ..  only:: html 
    
        We redirect ``std::err`` into the file :file:`trace_propagation.txt` (this what the ``2>`` stands for). You can find 
        a cleaned version of this file :download:`here <cpviz_nqueens4_basic.txt>`.
        
    ..  only:: latex
    
        We redirect ``std::err`` into the file :file:`cpviz_nqueens4_basic.txt`.
        
    We will transcibe the information contained in the file :file:`cpviz_nqueens4_basic.txt` but
    in a more graphical way. Pay attention to the order in which the variables and
    the constraints are processed.
    
    Recall that we are solving the problem of finding all distinct solutions
    of the n-queens problem with :math:`4` queens. Our search strategy is to
    choose the first variable with a non empty domain with a least two elements (``Solver::CHOOSE_FIRST_UNBOUND``).
    Once this variable is choosen, we give it the smallest possible value contained in its domain (``Solver::ASSIGN_MIN_VALUE``).
    We have :math:`4` variables :math:`x_0, x_1, x_2` and :math:`x_3` introduced in that order. The :math:`3` constraints 
    are all ``AllDifferent`` contraints introduced in the following order:
    
    ..  math::
    
        \textrm{AllDifferent}(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)\\
        \textrm{AllDifferent}(x_0, x_1 + 1, x_2 + 2, x_3 + 3)\\
        \textrm{AllDifferent}(x_0, x_1 - 1, x_2 - 2, x_3 - 3)

The search tree
"""""""""""""""

..  only:: draft

    By reading the file :file:`cpviz_nqueens4_basic.txt`, we can retrace the search and reconstruct the search tree:
    
    ..  image:: images/search_tree1.*
        :width: 297px
        :align: center
        :height: 286px
        :alt: alternate text
    
    As you can see, at each node, the solver took a ``Decision``: the left branch to *apply* the ``Decision`` and the right branch 
    to *refute* this ``Decision``. The leaf nodes in red denote subtrees that are not worth exploring explicitly: we cannot find any solution 
    along this branch of the tree. The leaf nodes in green denote on the contrary feasible solutions. The nodes are numbered in the order
    of creation and we can see that the search tree is traversed in pre-order by the solver.
    
    In the file :file:`nqeens4.cc`, we have printed some statistics about the search:
    
    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        std::cout << "Number of solutions: " << num_solutions << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Failures: " << s.failures() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Branches: " << s.branches() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Backtracks: " << s.fail_stamp() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Stamps: " << s.stamp() << std::endl;
    
    and when the ``size`` is :math:`4`, we get as output:
    
    ..  code-block:: bash
    
        Number of solutions: 2
        Failures: 6
        Branches: 10
        Backtracks: 9
        Stamps: 29

    Let's see if we can relate those statistics with the search tree. The three first statistics are easy to spot in the tree:
    
      Number of solutions (2):
        There are indeed two distinct solutions denoted by the two green leafs.
        
      Failures (6):
        A failure occurs whenever the solver has to backtrack, wether it is because of a real failure (nodes :math:`2-3` and :math:`9-10`)
        or a success (nodes :math:`5` and :math:`7`). Indeed, when the solver finds a solution, it has to backtrack to find other solutions.
        The method ``failures()`` returns the number of leaves of the search tree. In our case, :math:`6`.
        
      Branches (10):
        Number of branches in the tree, indeed :math:`10`.
        
      The two last statistics are more difficult to understand by only looking at the search tree.
      
      Backtracks (9):
        Because of the way the search is coded, the ``fail_stamp`` counter starts already at :math:`2` before any top level search.
        There are :math:`6` failures (one for each node, see Failures above) and this brings the counter to :math:`8`. To end the search, 
        a last backtrack [#real_last_backtrack]_ is necessary to reach the root node and undo the search which brings the counter to :math:`9`.
    
        ..  [#real_last_backtrack] Actually, the very last backtrack happens when the solver is deleted.
    
      Stamps (29):
        This statistic is more an internal statistic than a real indicator of the search. It is related to the 
        queue actions during the search. The queue is responsible for the reversibility of the search. At some 
        points during the search, the current state is pushed on the queue. When backtracking, the solver pops those states. Everytime
        a state is pushed or popped, the ``stamp`` counter is increased. Other queue actions also increase this counter. For instance, when 
        the queue is frozen or when a reversible action is added [#stamp_increased_by_reversible_actions]_. For a simple search,
        this statistic is more or less equivalent to the length of a pre-order traversal of the search tree (:math:`20` in our case). 
        This statistic reflects the amount of work needed by the solver during the search. We refer the curious reader
        to the source code for more details.
        
        ..  [#stamp_increased_by_reversible_actions] See the solver's ``AddBacktrackAction()`` method.

Propagation
"""""""""""

    To better understand the search, let's have a look at the propagation in details.

..  only:: html

    You can find an animated version of the propagation :download:`here <images/propagation/animated_propagation.gif>`.

..  only:: draft

    We start at the root node with
    
    ``node 0``: :math:`x_0 \in \{0,1,2,3\}, x_1 \in \{0,1,2,3\}, x_2 \in \{0,1,2,3\}, x_3 \in \{0,1,2,3\}`.
        We apply the ``Decision`` :math:`x_0 = 0` which corresponds to our search strategy.

        The propagation is done in the following order.
        
        ..  math::

        propagation is possible. We then apply the ``Decision`` :math:`x_1 = 2`

        We have a failure as the domaine of :math:`x_2` is empty. We backtrack to node :math:`1`
        and refute the ``Decision`` :math:`x_1 = 2`.

        (refuting the ``Decision`` :math:`x_1 = 2`).

        Propagation:
