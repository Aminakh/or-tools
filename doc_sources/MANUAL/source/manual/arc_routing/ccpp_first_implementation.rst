    Until now, we didn't really need a specialized data structure to store the graph used in the different routing problems:
    a two dimensional matrix did the trick. For 
    
    No need to reinvent the wheel, the *or-tools* library provides several dedicated data structures to represent graphs and 
    several algorithms (shortest paths, Hamiltonian paths, push-relabel flow algorithms and others, see the 
    :file:`src/graph` directory of the source code) to retrieve some information about them.
