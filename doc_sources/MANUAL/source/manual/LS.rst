    We enter here in a new world where we don't try to solve a problem to optimality but
    seek for a good approximate solution. Remember from section XXX: some problems
    [#actually_most_problems_are_hard]_ are hard to solve. No matter how powerful our computers are
    [#watch_out_for_quantic_computers]_, we quickly hit a wall if we try to solve these problems to optimality.
    Do we give up? Of course not! If it is not possible to extract the best solutions, 
    we can try to find very good solutions. Enter the fascinating world of (meta-)heuristics.
    
    Sometimes, we can have some kind of garantee on the quality of the solutions found and we speak 
    about *approximations*, sometimes we don't have a clue of what we are doing and we just hope 
    for the best.


    ..  [#actually_most_problems_are_hard] Actually, *most* problems!
    
    ..  [#watch_out_for_quantic_computers] But watch out for the next generation
        of computers: computers based on quantum mechanics!
