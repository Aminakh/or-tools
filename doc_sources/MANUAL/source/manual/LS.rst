Local search: the jobshop problem
===================================

..  only:: draft

    We enter here in a new world where we don't try to solve a problem to optimality but
    seek for a good solution. Remember from section XXX: some problems
    [#actually_most_problems_are_hard]_ are hard to solve. No matter how powerful our computers are
    [#watch_out_for_quantic_computers]_, we quickly hit a wall if we try to solve these problems to optimality.
    Do we give up? Of course not! If it is not possible to extract the best solutions, 
    we can try to find very good solutions. Enter the fascinating world of (meta-)heuristics and local search.
    
    ..  [#actually_most_problems_are_hard] Actually, *most* problems!
    
    ..  [#watch_out_for_quantic_computers] But watch out for the next generation
        of computers: computers based on quantum mechanics!
