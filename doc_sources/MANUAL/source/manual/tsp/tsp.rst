What is the Travelling Salesman Problem?
------------------------------------------

    If you want to know more about the TSP, visit the `TSP page <http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/>`_ which is the central place
    to discover this fascinating problem and hosts the best known implementation to solve the TSP (and it's open source!). 
    You also might be interested in the `8th DIMACS Implementation Challenge
    <http://www2.research.att.com/~dsj/chtsp/about.html>`_ held in 2001 about the TSP.

Benchmark data
-----------------

..  only:: draft

    The TSP is one of the most studied problems in Operations Research and there are several known benchmark data sources 
    on the internet. One of the most known is 
    the `TSPLIB page <http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/index.html>`_. 
    It's a little bit outdated but it contains a lot of instances and their proven optimal solutions. Their TSPLIB format
    is the de facto standard format to encode TSP instances.
    
The TSPLIB format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The TSPLIB format is explained in great details in the document 
    `TSPLIB95 <http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/DOC.PS>`_. Here is a small excerpt to understand the 
    basics. Refer to the TSPLIB95 document for more.
