Introduction to constraint programming
======================================

..  only:: draft

    In this chapter, we introduce *Constraint Programming* (CP) and present the content of this manual.
    We also introduce the *or-tools* library and its core principles.
    
..  rubric:: Overview:

..  only:: draft

    This chapter is divided in three parts. First, we introduce Constraint Programming and its working
    by looking at a real solving process done by our CP solver. Along the way, we will try to define
    Constraint Programming and show some practical problems where CP stands out. A little bit of theory
    will lay the foundations for the whole manual.
    Second, we introduce a simple strategy (the *three-stage method*) that can help you when confronted with 
    a problem to solve. You will see this method applied again and again in this manual. Another recurrent idea 
    in this manual is to be aware of tradeoffs. It is so important (and the key to successful optimization) 
    that we devote a whole section to this subject.
    Finally, we outline the general principles of the library and tell you where to find what in this manual.
