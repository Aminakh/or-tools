Introduction to constraint programming
======================================

..  only:: draft

    In this chapter, we introduce *Constraint Programming* (CP) and the *or-tools* library and 
    its core principles. We also present the content of this manual. 
    
..  rubric:: Overview:

..  only:: draft

    The chapter is divided in three parts. First, we introduce Constraint Programming 
    by looking at a solving process done by our CP solver. Along the way, we will try to define
    Constraint Programming and show some practical problems where CP stands out. A little bit of theory
    will lay the foundations for the whole manual.
    Second, we introduce a simple strategy (the *three-stage method*) that can help us when confronted with 
    a problem to solve. This method will be applied repeatedly in this manual. Another recurrent idea 
    in this manual is to be aware of tradeoffs. This idea is the key to successful optimization and well worth a whole section.
    Finally, we outline the general principles of the library and detail the content of this manual.

    - None. Being open minded, relaxed and prepared to enjoy the *or-tools* library helps though.
