    We give you in a nutshell the important ideas and 
    the vocabulary we use throughout this manual. In the section :ref:`constraint_satisfaction_problem`,
    we cover the basic vocabulary to talk about the problems we solve in CP. The section
    :ref:`complexity_in_a_few_lines` introduces informally *complexity theory* [#time_complexity]_. 
    One of the difficulties of this 
    theory is that there are a lot of technical details no to be missed. We have tried 
    in this section to introduce you to important ideas without being drawn into too many details 
    (some inescapable details are in the footnotes).

    ..  [#time_complexity] We talk here about *Time*-complexity theory, i.e. we are concerned with the time we need 
                           to solve problems. There exist other complexity theories, for instance the *Space*-complexity 
                           theory where we are concerned with the memory space needed to solve problems.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Constraint Optimization Problems (COP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


..  only:: html

    We illustrate the different components of a 
    Constraint Satisfaction Problem with the 4-queens problem we saw in the section :ref:`four_queens_problem`.
    Each time, we use a general definition (for instance variable :math:`x_i`) and then illustrate this definition by 
    the 4-queens problem (for instance variable :math:`x_{21}`).


..  raw:: latex

    We illustrate the different components of a 
    Constraint Satisfaction Problem with the 4-queens problem we saw in 
    section~\ref{manual/introduction/4queens:four-queens-problem}.


A **CSP** consists of 

  * a set of **variables** :math:`X = \{x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}\}`.
    
    Ex.: For the 4-queens problem, we have a binary variable :math:`x_{ij}` indicating the presence or not of a queen
    on square :math:`(i,j)`:
    
    ..  math::
    
        X = \{x_{00}, x_{01}, x_{02}, x_{03}, x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{12},  \ldots, x_{33}\}

  * for each variable :math:`x_i`, a *finite* set :math:`D_i` of possible values (its **domain**).
  
    Ex.: Each variable :math:`x_{ij}` is a binary variable, thus 
    
    ..  math:: 
        
        D_{00} = D_{01} = \ldots = D_{33} = \{0,1\}.

  * **constraints** that restrict the values the variables can take simultaneously.
  
    Ex.: Constraints that avoid that two queens are on the same row:
    
    ..  math::
    
        \begin{array}{rlcr}
        \text{row 0:} & x_{00} + x_{01} + x_{02} + x_{03} & \leqslant & 1\\
        \text{row 1:} & x_{10} + x_{11} + x_{12} + x_{13} & \leqslant & 1\\
        \text{row 2:} & x_{20} + x_{21} + x_{22} + x_{23} & \leqslant & 1\\
        \text{row 3:} & x_{30} + x_{31} + x_{32} + x_{33} & \leqslant & 1\\
        \end{array}

    ..  only:: html
    
        Indeed, these constraints ensure that for each row :math:`i` at most one variable 
        :math:`x_{i0}, x_{i1}, x_{i2}` or 
        :math:`x_{i3}` could take the value :math:`1`. Actually, we could replace the inequalities by equalities because 
        we know that every feasible solution must have a queen on each row. Later, in the 
        section :ref:`nqueen_implementation_basic_model`, we will provide
        another model with other variables and constraints.

    ..  raw:: latex
    
        Indeed, these constraints ensure that for each row $i$ at most one variable $x_{i0}, x_{i1}, x_{i2}$ or 
        $x_{i3}$ could take the value $1$. Actually, we could replace the inequalities by equalities because 
        we know that every feasible solution must have a queen on each row. Later, 
        in section~\ref{manual/search_primitives/basic_model_implementation:nqueen-implementation-basic-model}, 
        we will provide another model with other variables and constraints.

As we mentioned earlier, values don't need to be integers and constraints don't need to be 
algebraic equations or inequalities [#only_constraint_on_constraint_in_cp]_.

..  [#only_constraint_on_constraint_in_cp] Basically, the only requirement for a constraint in CP is its ability to be 
    propagated.

If we want to *optimize*, i.e. to *minimize* or *maximize* an *objective function*, we talk about a Constraint Optimization 
Problem (**COP**). The **objective function** can be one of the variables of the problem or a function of some or all the variables.

A **feasible solution** to a CSP or a COP is a feasible assignment: every variable has been assigned a value from its domain
in such a way that *all* the constraints of the model are respected. The **objective value** of a feasible solution is 
the value of the objective function for this solution. An **optimal solution** to a COP is a feasible solution such
that there are no other solutions with better objective values. Note that an optimal solution doesn't need to exist nor is it 
unique.

Problems, instances and solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  only:: draft

    We will not go into details about what a problem exactly is. We just saw two examples of problems (CSP and COP).
    Let us emphasize that the or-tools CP-solver deals only with discrete and finite variables, i.e. the values 
    a variable can take are elements of a finite set. If you want to solve a continuous problem,
    you need to discretize it.
    
    One of the most basic problems is the SAT problem. This is the problem of determining if the variables of 
    a given Boolean formula can be assigned 
    (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
    in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to `TRUE`. 

    Here is an example of such a formula:
    
    
    Feasible solutions don't need to be real solutions for a problem. You could be interested in an approximate solution
    because 
    finding an exact solution might be too expensive. 

..  _two_important_ideas_complexity_theory_hurried_reader:

Two important ideas of the complexity theory for the hurried reader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If you prefer not to read the next section, we have summarized its main ideas:

- problems are divided in two categories [#more_than_one_category]_: **easy** 
  (:math:`\text{P}` problems) and **hard** (:math:`\text{NP-Hard}` or :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` problems)
  problems. Hard problems are also called *intractable* [#intractable]_ and in general we only can find 
  approximate solutions for such problems [#good_vs_proven]_.
  Actually, the question of being able to find exact solutions to hard problems is still open (See the box 
  "The :math:`P \stackrel{?}{=} NP` question" below);
    
- good solutions (vs. exact solutions) are called *approximations* and since the '90s a considerable 
  effort was invested in designing a *complexity
  theory of approximations*. There is a whole zoo of complexity classes. Some problems can be approximated but without any
  guarantee on the quality of the solution, others can be approximated with as much precision as you desire but 
  you have to pay the price for this precision: the more precision you want the slower your algorithm will be.
  For some problems it is hard to find approximations and for others, it is even impossible to find an approximation with 
  any guarantee on its quality!

..  [#more_than_one_category] Most problems of practical interest belong to either categories but these two categories 
    don't cover all problems.
    

..  [#garey_outdated] This book was written in 1979 and so misses the last developments of the complexity theory 
                      but it clearly explains the NP-Completeness theory and 
                      provides a long list of NP-Complete problems.

..  [#intractable] *Intractable problems* are problems which in practice take too long to solve exactly, so there 
                   is a gap between the theoretical definition (:math:`\textrm{NP-Hard}` problems) and the 
                   practical definition (*Intractable* problems).

..  [#good_vs_proven] Technically, you could find an exact solution but you would not be able to prove that 
                      it is indeed an exact solution in general.

    Some problems such as the *Travelling Salesman Problem* (see the chapter :ref:`chapter_tsp_with_constraints`) 
    are hard to solve [#difficult_to_solve]_: 
    no one could ever come up 
    with a very efficient algorithm to solve this problem. On the other hand, other problems, 
    like the *Chinese Postman Problem*
    (see the chapter :ref:`chapter_arc_routing_with_constraints`), are solved very efficiently. 
    In the '70s, complexity experts were able to translate this
    fact into a beautiful *complexity theory*. 

    ..  [#difficult_to_solve] Roughly, we consider a problem to be hard to solve if we need a lot of time to solve it. Read on.

..  raw:: latex

    Some problems such as the \emph{Travelling Salesman Problem} 
    (see chapter~\ref{manual/TSP:chapter-tsp-with-constraints}) 
    are hard to solve\footnote{Roughly, we consider a problem to be hard to solve if we need a 
    lot of time to solve it. Read on.}: 
    no one could ever come up
    with a very efficient algorithm to solve this problem. On the other hand, other problems, 
    like the \emph{Chinese Postman Problem}
    (see chapter~\ref{manual/arc_routing:chapter-arc-routing-with-constraints}), 
    are solved very efficiently. 
    In the '70s, complexity experts were able to 
    translate this fact into a beautiful \emph{complexity theory}.\\~\\ 

Hard to solve problems are called *intractable* problems. When you cannot solve an intractable 
problem to optimality, you can
try to find good solutions or/and *approximate* the problem. In the '90s, complexity experts continued their
investigation on the 
complexity of solving problems and developed what is now known as the *approximation complexity theory*. Both theories
are quite new,
very interesting and ... not easy to understand. We try the *tour the force* to introduce them in a few lines.
We willingly kept certain technical details out of the way. These technical details *are important* and actually without 
them, you can not construct a complexity theory.


..  _intractability:

Intractability
""""""""""""""""""""


One of the main difficulties complexity experts faced in the '70s was to come up with a theoretical 
definition of the complexity 
of problems not algorithms. Indeed, it is relatively easy [#complexity_algo_difficult]_ to define a complexity measure of 
algorithms but how would you define 
the complexity of a problem? If you have an efficient algorithm to solve a problem, you could say that the problem 
belongs to the set of easy problems but what about difficult problems? 
The fact that we don't know an efficient algorithm to solve 
these doesn't mean these problems are really difficult. Someone could come up one day with an efficient algorithm!
The solution the experts came up with was to build equivalence classes between problems and define the complexity of 
a problem with respect to the complexity of other problems (so the notion of complexity is relative not absolute): 
a problem :math:`A` is as hard as a problem :math:`B` if there exists an efficient transformation :math:`\tau` 
that maps every 
instance :math:`b` of  
problem :math:`B` into an instance :math:`\tau(b) = a` of problem :math:`A` such that if solve :math:`a`, 
you solve :math:`b`.

        :height: 100px
        :align: center


Indeed, if there exists an efficient algorithm to solve 
problem :math:`A`, you can also solve efficiently problem :math:`B`: transform an instance :math:`b` into into 
an instance :math:`\tau(b) = a` of problem :math:`A` and solve it with the efficient algorithm known to solve problem 
:math:`A`. So problem :math:`A` is as difficult as
problem :math:`B` (because if you know an efficient algorithm to solve problem :math:`A`, you can solve problem :math:`B`
as efficiently) and we write :math:`B \leqslant_{\text{T}} A` and say that problem :math:`B` *reduces efficiently* 
to problem :math:`A`
or that :math:`\tau` is an *efficient reduction* [#AlanTuringT]_.
The search for an efficient algorithm is replaced by the search for an efficient reduction between 
instances of two problems to prove complexity.

..  [#complexity_algo_difficult] Well, to a certain degree. You need to know what instances you consider, how these are 
                                 encoded, what type of machines you use and so on.

..  [#AlanTuringT] The :math:`\text{T}` in :math:`\leqslant_{\text{T}}` is in honor of Alan Turing. Different types of 
                   efficient reductions exist.


This main idea leads to a lot of technicalities:

  - how to measure the complexity of an algorithm?
  - what is an efficient transformation?
  - what are the requirements for such a reduction?
  - ...

We don't answer these interesting questions except the one on efficiency. We consider a reduction 
:math:`\tau` *efficient*
if there exist a polynomial-time bounded algorithm (this refers to the first question...) that can transform any 
instance :math:`b` of problem :math:`B` into an instance :math:`a` of problem :math:`A` such that the solutions 
correspond. This also means that we 
consider an algorithm *efficient* if it is *polynomially time-bounded* (otherwise the efficiency of the 
reduction would be useless).

The class of problems that can be efficiently solved is called :math:`P`, i.e. the class of problems that can be solved by 
a polynomial-time bounded algorithm [#P_technically_speaking]_ [#P_in_Practice]_. 

..  [#P_technically_speaking] For technical reasons, we don't compare problems but *languages* and only consider
    *decision problems*, i.e. problems that have a *yes/no* answer. The *Subset Sum Problem* is such a problem.
    Given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? The answer is yes or no. By extension,
    we say an optimization problem is in :math:`P`, if its equivalent *decision problem* is in :math:`P`. For instance, 
    the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is an optimization problem where one wants to find a minimal route 
    traversing all edges 
    of a graph. The equivalent decision problem is " *Is it possible to find a feasible route with cost less or equal 
    to* :math:`k` *?* " where :math:`k` is a given integer. By extension, we will say that the CPP
    is in :math:`P` (we should rather say that the CPP is in :math:`P-\text{optimization}`).

..  [#P_in_Practice] This discussion is really about *theoretical* difficulties of problems. Some problems that 
                     are theoretically easy (such as solving a Linear System or a Linear Program) are difficult in 
                     practice and conversely, some problems that are theoretically difficult, such as the Knapsack Problem 
                     are routinely solved on big instances.

Some problems are difficult to solve but once you have an answer, it is quite straightforward to verify that a
given solution is indeed the solution of the problem. One such problem is the *Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP)*. 
Given a graph, is there a path that visits each vertex exactly once? Finding such a path is difficult but verifying 
that a given path is indeed an Hamiltonian path, i.e. that passes exactly once through each vertex, can be 
easily done. Problems for which it is easy to verify their solutions, i.e. for which this verification can be done 
in polynomial time, are said to be in the class :math:`NP` [#NP_term]_. :math:`P \subset NP` because if you can 
find a solution in polynomial time, you can also verify this solution in polynomial time (just construct it). 
Whether we have equality or not 
between these two sets is one of the major unsolved theoretical questions in Operations Research (see the box 
"The :math:`P \stackrel{?}{=} NP` question" below).

..  [#NP_term] The abbreviation :math:`NP` refers to *non-deterministic polynomial time*, not to *non-polynomial*.

Not all problems in :math:`\text{NP}` seem to be of equal complexity. Some problems, such as the HPP are as hard as any problem 
in :math:`\text{NP}`. Remember our classification of the complexity of problems? This means that every problem in :math:`\text{NP}` can 
be transformed in polynomial time into the HPP. The hardest problems of :math:`\text{NP}` form the class of :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` problems.

..  topic:: How can you prove that all problems in :math:`\text{NP}` are reducible to a problem?

    Wait a minute. There is an infinite number of problems in :math:`\text{NP}`, many of which are unknown to us.
    So, how is it possible to prove that all problems in :math:`\text{NP}` can be reduced to a problem (and 
    hereby proving that this problem belongs to the set of :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` problems?
    
    This is done in two steps:
    
    1. First, you have to know that the reduction is *transitive*. This means that if :math:`A \leqslant_{\text{T}} B`
       and :math:`B \leqslant_{\text{T}} C` then :math:`A \leqslant_{\text{T}} C`. Thus, if you have one problem 
       :math:`Z` such that all problems :math:`A_i` in :math:`\text{NP}` are reducible to :math:`Z`, i.e. 
       :math:`A_i \leqslant_{\text{T}} Z`, then to prove that all problems :math:`A_i` in :math:`\text{NP}` reduce 
       to a problem :math:`X`, you just need to prove that :math:`Z` reduces to :math:`X`. Indeed, if 
       :math:`Z \leqslant_{\text{T}} X` then :math:`A_i \leqslant_{\text{T}} Z \leqslant_{\text{T}} X`
       [#to_prove_NP_completeness]_.

       The funny fact is that if :math:`X` is in :math:`\text{NP}`, then :math:`X \leqslant_{\text{T}} Z` also.
       If you can solve one problem in :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` efficiently, you can solve all the problems 
       in :math:`\text{NP}` efficiently!
        
    2. Several researchers (like for example Cook and Levin in the early '70s, 
       see `Wikipedia on the Cook-Levin Theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_theorem>`_), were able to 
       prove that
       all problems in :math:`\text{NP}` are reducible in polynomial time to the *Boolean satisfiability problem* (SAT).
       
       Proving that the SAT problem is :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` is a major achievement in the complexity
       theory (the proof is highly technical).
        

..  [#to_prove_NP_completeness] If you want to prove that a problem :math:`Y` is :math:`\text{NP-Hard}` (see below), 
    take a problem that is :math:`\text{NP-Complete}`, like the HPP, and reduce it to your problem. This might sound easy
    but it is not!

Finally, if a problem is as hard as an :math:`\text{NP-Complete}` problem, it is called an :math:`\text{NP-Hard}` problem.
Optimization problems, whose decision version belong to :math:`\text{NP-Complete}`, fall into this category. 

The next figure summarizes the relations between the complexity classes [#zoo_complexity_classes]_ we have seen as most of the experts believe they stand, i.e. :math:`\text{P} \neq \text{NP}`.

..  _thePvsNPquestion:

..  topic:: The :math:`P \stackrel{?}{=} NP` question

    The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in Computer Science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer (:math:`\in \text{NP}`) can also be quickly solved by a computer (:math:`\in \text{P}`). It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute. The offered prize
    to the first team to solve this question is $1,000,000!

    colleagues what they thought 
    about the :math:`P \stackrel{?}{=} NP` question. Here are the results:

The practical aspect of intractability
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


If you try to solve a problem that is proven to be :math:`\text{NP-Hard}`, you know that it is 
probably an intractable problem (if :math:`P \neq NP`). At least, you know that no one could ever come with an efficient 
algorithm to solve it and that it is unlikely to happen soon. Thus, you can not solve big instances of your 
problem. What can you do?

Maybe there are special cases that can be solved in polynomial time? If you are not interested in these cases and 
your instances are too big to be solved exactly, even with parallel and/or decomposition algorithms, then there is only 
one thing to do: approximate your problem and/or the solutions. 

You could simplify your problem and/or be satisfied with an approximation, i.e. a solution that is not exact nor optimal.
One way to do this in CP is to relax the model by softening some constraints [#softening_constraints]_. In a nutshell, 
you soften a constraint by allowing this constraint to be violated. In a approximate solution where the constraint is 
violated, you penalize the objective function by a certain amount corresponding to the violation. The bigger the 
violation, the bigger the penalty. The idea is to find a solution that doesn't violate too much the soft constraints in 
the hope that such approximate solution isn't that different from an exact or optimal solution
[#different_solution_optimization]_.

..  [#softening_constraints] For MIP practitioners, this is equivalent to *Lagrangian Relaxation*.

..  [#different_solution_optimization] In the case of optimization, a solution that *isn't that different* means a 
    solution that has a good objective value, preferably close to the optimum.
