A little bit of theory
----------------------

..  only:: draft

    If you are allergic to theory, you can completely skip this section. We give you in a nutshell the important ideas and 
    vocabulary we use throughout this manual. Of course - we took the time to write it, right? - we are convinced that 
    you will benefit from reading it. 
    
    Here are the main ideas:
    
      - problems are divided in two categories: **easy** (:math:`\in \textrm{P}`) and **hard** (:math:`\in \textrm{NP}`) problems. 
        The last ones are also called *intractable* and in general we only can find good solutions not optimal ones for those problems.
        Actually, this question is still open (:math:`P \stackrel{?}{=} NP`) and there is a one million dollars prize to decide this question;
        
      - good solutions are called *approximations* and since the '90ties a lot of effort has been spent in a complexity
        theory of approximations. There is a whole zoo of complexity classes. Some problems car be approximated but without any
        guarantee on the quality of the solution, others can be approximated with as much precision you desire but you have to pay the price
        for this precision. For some problems it is even hard to find approximations!

    Actually, no one could prove that these problems are intrinsically different.
    Footnote: this is the famous :math:`\textrm{P} \stackrel{?}{=} \textrm{NP}` question.
