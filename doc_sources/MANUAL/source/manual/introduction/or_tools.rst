The Google or-tools library
---------------------------

..  At this time or writing, the or-tools library is not MT_SAFE, nor MT_HOT. 

..  this is a test :solver:`Solver <operations_research::Solver>`. Did it work? 

..  only:: draft

    The Google *or-tools* open source library was publicly released in September 2010.
    Since then it has evolved to a huge project containing more than 65K lines of code written in ``C++``! The constraint programming part
    - including the important vehicle routing engine  - has the lion's share with approximatively 55K lines of code.
    
    Beside ``C++``, you can use the library through ``SWIG`` in ``Python``, 
    ``Java``, and ``.NET`` (using ``mono`` on non ``Windows`` platforms).
