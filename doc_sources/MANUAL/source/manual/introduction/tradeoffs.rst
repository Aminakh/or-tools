    This manual is about the *or-tools* library and its working but along the way, we also try to give you

    ..  topic:: The good optimization researcher's motto:
    
        :math:`\text{It's always a matter of tradeoffs}`
    
    This motto is a shorcut to describe a few basic and common ideas in research that are 
    often forgotten or put aside but that can be life-saving when consistently adopted. We will
    refer to this motto from time to time in this manual.

    Ultimatetely, you are best aware of your problem and the (limited) ressources you have to solve it. 
    As we said:
    
    ..  math::
    
        \text{It's all a matter of tradeoffs.}
