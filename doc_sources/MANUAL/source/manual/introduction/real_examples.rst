    Since the '90s, CP is used by small and major companies around the world including Google. It has become 
    the techology of choice for some problems in scheduling, rostering, timetabling, and configuration.
    
    Here is a non-exhaustive list [#simonis_inspiration]_ were CP has being used with success:
    
    * Production sequencing
    * Production scheduling
    * Satellite tasking
    * Maintenance planning
    * Transport
    * Stand allocation
    * Personnel assignment 
    * Personnel requirement planning
    * Hardware design 
    * Compilation
    * Financial problems
    * Placement 
    * Cutting problems 
    * Air traffic control
    * Frequency allocation
    * Network configuration
    * Product design
    * Product blending 
    * Time tabling 
    * Production step planning
    * Crew rotation 
    * Aircraft rotation 
    * Supply chain management
    * Routing
    * Manufactoring
    * Ressource allocation
    * Circuit verification
    * Simulation
    * ...

Success stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  only:: draft

    We could list hundreds of success stories were CP made a - sometimes **huge** - difference but we don't want to 
    advertise any company. You'll find plenty on the web. Let us just advertise CP as a very efficient and convenient tool
    to solve industrial problems.
    
    Most of the time, CP :
    
    - solves your problem within minutes;
    - only needs the push of a button (after setting some parameters and giving some data of course);
    - is very flexible and easily allows you to add or remove side constraints;
    - improve solutions *found by hand* by up to sometimes 30%.
    
    This can only happen if you find the right software that is readily well-adapted to your problem. Otherwise, 
    a good option is to develop the product yourself. 

Can CP be compared to the holy grail of Operations Research?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  only:: draft

    From time to time, people search for the holy grail of Operations Research. We could define it as the pursuit to
    solving arbitrary combinatorial optimisation problems with one algorithm. As E. Freuder states it: 
    "the user states the problem, the computer solves it."
    
     

    Integer programming
    A Simulated Annealing code for General Integer Linear Programs (1997):
    "For many years the holy grail of operations research has been an efficient integer solver which can be applied to a wide range of problems with little modification"
  
    Try of modelizing language (AMPL, Mosek, etc): didn't really work. Handy but...
    
    Bartak:
    holy grail of Operations Research

    Roman Bartak *Constraint Programming: In Pursuit of the Holy Grail*, Proceedings of WDS99, 1999, pp 555-564.

    No, we disagree. Problems are specific and need specific algorithm to solve them. There isn't a single paradigm 
    that can solve all problems. Question related to P = NP.
