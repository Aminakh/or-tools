    We don't have much to say about the CVRP as much has been said in the section :ref:`vrp_vrp`. The side constraint we 
    add here to the VRP is a capacity constraint: each vehicle must respect its capacity on the route it traverses.

The problem
-------------

..  only:: draft

    The *Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)* is one class of Vehicle Routing Problems where the vehicles have a certain 
    capacity they can not exceed. A client can only be serviced by **one** vehicle. 
    The depot is the same for all vehicles and doesn't need to be 
    serviced. 
    
    In this version, vehicles have all the same capacity :math:`C` that cannot be exceeded on a tour and clients 
    have *demands*. A client :math:`i`  has a demand :math:`d_i` that has to be met when a vehicle service this client. 
    Think of demands as quantities of goods that the vehicle pick up when visiting clients: the total among of goods/demands 
    picked up along the route cannot exceed its capacity.
    
    The program :program:`check_cvrp_solution` allows you to check if indeed the capacities of the vehicles are respected 
    along the routes. For instance, invoking:
    
    ..  code-block:: bash
    
        ./check_cvrp_solution -log_level=1 -instance_file=A-n32-k5.vrp 
                                                -solution_file=opt-A-n32-k5
    
    prints:
    
    ..  code-block:: bash
    
        Route 1 with capacity 100
         Servicing node 22 with demand 12 (capacity left: 88)
         Servicing node 32 with demand 0 (capacity left: 88)
         Servicing node 20 with demand 24 (capacity left: 64)
         Servicing node 18 with demand 19 (capacity left: 45)
         Servicing node 14 with demand 16 (capacity left: 29)
         Servicing node 8 with demand 16 (capacity left: 13)
         Servicing node 27 with demand 2 (capacity left: 11)
        Route 2 with capacity 100
         Servicing node 13 with demand 21 (capacity left: 79)
         Servicing node 2 with demand 19 (capacity left: 60)
         Servicing node 17 with demand 18 (capacity left: 42)
         Servicing node 31 with demand 14 (capacity left: 28)
        Route 3 with capacity 100
         Servicing node 28 with demand 20 (capacity left: 80)
         Servicing node 25 with demand 24 (capacity left: 56)
        Route 4 with capacity 100
         Servicing node 30 with demand 2 (capacity left: 98)
         Servicing node 19 with demand 1 (capacity left: 97)
         Servicing node 9 with demand 6 (capacity left: 91)
         Servicing node 10 with demand 16 (capacity left: 75)
         Servicing node 23 with demand 4 (capacity left: 71)
         Servicing node 16 with demand 22 (capacity left: 49)
         Servicing node 11 with demand 8 (capacity left: 41)
         Servicing node 26 with demand 24 (capacity left: 17)
         Servicing node 6 with demand 7 (capacity left: 10)
         Servicing node 21 with demand 8 (capacity left: 2)
        Route 5 with capacity 100
         Servicing node 15 with demand 3 (capacity left: 97)
         Servicing node 29 with demand 15 (capacity left: 82)
         Servicing node 12 with demand 14 (capacity left: 68)
         Servicing node 5 with demand 19 (capacity left: 49)
         Servicing node 24 with demand 8 (capacity left: 41)
         Servicing node 4 with demand 6 (capacity left: 35)
         Servicing node 3 with demand 21 (capacity left: 14)
         Servicing node 7 with demand 12 (capacity left: 2)
        Solution is feasible!
        Obj value = 784

    As you can see, each vehicle has its capacity respected and in case you wonder, we use the real node identifiers in this output.
    
    In the next section, we show you how to individualize each vehicle (its cost to use it, its own capacity, its 
    costs to traverse an edge).
    
   
    Exact methods can solve instances with 100 clients (see [Roberti2012]_) but even heuristics are limited to solve 
    instances with more or less 1200 clients (see [Groër2011]_). Most efficient heuristics are a combination of integer 
    programing with 
    local search (see [Toth2008]_ or [Groër2011]_).

        [TO BE WRITTEN]

The ``CVRPData`` class: part II
-------------------------------------

..  only:: draft

    To play with instances and see how solutions can change when you change some parts of the instances, the 
    ``CVRPData`` class provides some setters:
    
    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        void SetDepot(RoutingModel::NodeIndex d);
        void SetDemand(const RoutingModel::NodeIndex i, int64 demand);
        void SetCapacity(int64 capacity);
        
    You even can change the distance between two nodes ``i`` and ``j``:
    
    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        CVRPData cvrp_data(...);
        ...
        RoutingModel::NodeIndex i = ...;
        RoutingModel::NodeIndex j = ...;
        int64 new_distance = ...;
        cvrp_data.SetDistance(i, j) = new_distance;

    Notice that the call to ``SetDistance()`` is different because it returns a ``lvalue`` (left value) [#cplusplus_left_value]_.

    You also have the corresponding getters:
    
    ..  code-block:: c++
    
        RoutingModel::NodeIndex Depot() const;
        int64 Demand(const RoutingModel::NodeIndex i) const;
        int64 TotalDemand() const;
        int64 Capacity() const;
        int64 Distance(RoutingModel::NodeIndex i, 
                       RoutingModel::NodeIndex j) const;
        

    The ``TotalDemand()`` method simply return the sum of all demands for all clients.

    ..  [#cplusplus_left_value] You don't need to know the details of what exactly a ``lvalue`` is in C++. It's enough 
        to know that you can use a ``lvalue`` in a assignment (left of the equal sign).
