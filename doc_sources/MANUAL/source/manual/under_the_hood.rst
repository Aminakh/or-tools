Under the hood
==============

..  only:: draft

    This chapter is intended for those who are curious about the code or/and want to contribute to the code. 
    We do go quite deep into 
    the details, so this chapter is not for the faint of hart. ;-) If you are curious about one way to implement a CP Solver,
    keep reading.

        If you haven't read the 
        sections~\ref{manual/search_primitives/basic_working_search_algorithm:basic-working-search-algorithm}  
        and~\ref{manual/ls/basic_working2:basic-workingii}  yet, 
        we strongly encourage you to do so. These two sections explain the basics of the CP solver.
