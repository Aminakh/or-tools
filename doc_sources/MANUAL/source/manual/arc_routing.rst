Arc Routing  Problems with constraints: the cumulative chinese postman problem
======================================================================================

..  only:: draft

    Arc Routing Problems (ARP) consist in problems where you must serve/visit arcs and/or edges in a graph/network.
    In contrast to Node Routing Problems (NRP, see XXX) and Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP, see XXX), ARP deals with 
    non-complete graphs and solutions often require to visit an edge/arc several times.

    ..  warning::
    
        Only use the RL to solve ARP for which a transformation into a NRP make sense!
