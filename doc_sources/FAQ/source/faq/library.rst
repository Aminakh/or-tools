.. _faq:library:separate_directory:

How can I use a separate directory, i.e. a directory outside the main or-tools directory, to compile and run my code?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:when_released:

When was the library released?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was released as an open project in September 2010.

.. _faq:library:licence:

What is the licence you use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:really_free:

Is it really free and open source?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:guarantuees:

What guarantees do you provide about the quality of this library?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:language_coded:

In what language(s) is the library coded?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:language_supported:

What are the supported languages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:supported_platforms:

What are the supported platforms?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq:library:use_at_google:

Do you use this library at Google?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! The code we have released is a subset of all the OR tools we are
developing at Google. This code is used internally. We will maintain
this open-source branch in sync with our internal code and will likely
contribute more tools, more technology. 

.. _faq:library:future:

What is the future of this library?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, we don't have a crystal ball to see into the future
and we don't know what might happen but as far as we are concerned our intentions are clear: 
this library will remain actively developed and open sourced.

.. _faq:library:future_plans:

What new technologies do you plan to release in the future?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While we have a clear idea about the tools we would like to add (or already have implemented in our internal version of the library)
we don't want to commit publicly. We develop the library primary for our internal needs and offer parts of our code along the way.
If you have followed this project since its open source release, you know that it is under active development. We don't plan to change
this.

.. _faq:library:why_open_source:

Why did Google, a private company, open source such a project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
