Hello,

This is the source documentation repositery. It contains all the necessary 
documents (sources, templates, scripts) to generate the documentation.

If you are curious about the tools we use to generate our documentation, have 
a look.

If you are a user of the or-tools library and you are only interested in the 
documentation (not the generation process) don't download the documentation
sources. The documentation is available here: 

http://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/documentation_hub.html

* THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. SOURCES MAY CONTAIN APPROXIMATIONS OR EVEN ERRORS. *
* SCRIPTS MAY NOT WORK AS INTENTED AND ARE NOT (YET) TESTED.                   *

See doc/howto.pdf to generate the documentation of the or-tools library.

Have a nice day!
